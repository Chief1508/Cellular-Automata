Cellular Automata Simulations

This repository contains multiple Cellular Automata (CA) simulations implemented using p5.js.


**1D Cellular Automata Simulation**

This folder contains a simulation of elementary cellular automata following Wolfram's rules. Users can:

Set the rule number (0-255)

Adjust grid size and iteration steps

Toggle between numeric and visual representations

**Running the Simulation**

Open index.html in a browser.

Adjust the rule, array size, and iteration steps as needed.

Click "Set Parameters" to update the simulation.

**Forest Fire Simulation**

This folder contains a fire spread model where fire propagates through a forest based on adjustable probabilities. Users can:

Set tree regrowth and fire spread rates

Click on a tree to start a fire

Observe how fire spreads dynamically

**Running the Simulation**

Open index.html inside the Simulation/ folder.

Adjust fire spread and tree regrowth rates.

Click "Apply" to set new parameters.

**Installation**

No additional setup is required. Just open the HTML files in a browser to run the simulations.

**License**

This project is open-source and can be freely modified and distributed.
